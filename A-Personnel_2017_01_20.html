    <p>
      The Victor-Farmington Volunteer Ambulance staff is primarily made up of volunteers, who donate a combined 33,000 hours each year. The staff also includes five full-time career staff Paramedics. For executive level operation, members are elected as executive officers and appointed as operational personnel. Day to day operation of the ambulance corps is based upon on pre-set primary duty shifts as well as back-up duty shifts. Our crews are stationed at our base to reduce response time to an emergency. They provide both Basic Life Support (BLS) services as well as Advanced Life Support (ALS) services. Our staff can perform heart monitoring and can administer life saving medications on the way to the hospital, often saving and preventing further threats to life during the transport time to hospitals. </p>
