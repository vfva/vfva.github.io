    <p class="altHeadlines" style="font-size:18px; line-height:26px;">Victor Farmington Ambulance is proud to offer a variety of training opportunities to area residents and businesses. Early First Aid and CPR can mean the difference between life and death and the initial care that you may be able to provide your friends and family can dramatically increase their chances of survival in cardiac arrest situations. According to the American Heart Association 70% of all sudden cardiac arrests happen at home and many victims of sudden cardiac arrest appear healthy and have no known heart disease prior to the event! The life you save with First Aid and CPR is likely to be someone you love.</p>
